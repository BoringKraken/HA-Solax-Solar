# 🔆 Custom Home Assistant Solar Integration - AI Coding Primer

## 📌 Purpose

This project is a custom Home Assistant integration (via HACS) designed to connect to a solar panel system and expose rich sensor data for energy monitoring, tracking, and automation.

The goal is to collect as much real-time and historical data as possible and enrich it with calculated values useful for dashboards and automations.

---

## 🧭 Objectives

- Fetch and expose all available sensors from the solar panel system.
- Generate derived metrics (e.g. energy per hour/day/week/month).
- Support long-term statistics for analytics.
- Be configurable via YAML or UI (future option).
- Integrate with the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard if compatible.

---

## 📡 Data Collection

The integration should:

- Connect to the solar system's local/cloud API or direct network endpoint.
- Poll data at an interval (e.g. 30–60 seconds).
- Retrieve the following, where available:
  - `watts_now` (current generation)
  - `energy_today`, `energy_this_week`, `energy_this_month`
  - `battery_percentage`, `battery_charge/discharge`
  - `inverter_status`, `system_status`
  - `grid_import`, `grid_export`
  - `temperature` of panels or inverter
  - `system_uptime`, `error_states`

If certain metrics aren’t available natively, attempt to derive or approximate them.

## 🧠 Data Enrichment

If only instantaneous values are available (e.g., `watts_now`), derive time-based metrics:

- `solar_energy_last_hour`
- `solar_energy_today`
- `solar_energy_this_week`
- `solar_energy_this_month`

Use time-windowed rolling sums or similar calculations.  
Ensure derived sensors support Home Assistant Recorder and long-term statistics so they appear in graphs and history.

---

## 🔧 Code Structure

Follow Home Assistant's standard integration pattern:

custom_components/ solar_integration/ init.py sensor.py manifest.json hacs.json


- Use `SensorEntity` from `homeassistant.components.sensor`.
- Follow async patterns with `async_setup_entry`.
- Register entities dynamically based on detected sensors.
- Domain: `solar_integration`
- Optional config options: custom update interval, manual sensor overrides

---

## ⚙️ HACS Compatibility

Ensure compatibility with HACS:

- Include a valid `manifest.json` with required fields
- Add `hacs.json` for metadata
- Directory structure must match HACS standards
- Integration should be discoverable via custom HACS repo

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Provide example config entries
- Include debug logging for sensor pulls and errors
- Use `hassfest` and/or `home-assistant` CLI to validate
- Test against recent Home Assistant releases (2024.x+)
- Handle sensor availability/failure gracefully

---

## 📝 Stretch Goals

- Multi-system support
- User-defined sensor aliases/naming
- InfluxDB / Grafana compatibility
- Auto-detect system vendor (e.g. Fronius, Sungrow, Enphase, etc.)
- Optional MQTT publishing for external tools

---

## 🚀 Let’s Go

This primer is designed to help guide AI-assisted coding (e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT) or developer contributions to build a flexible, powerful integration for solar energy tracking in Home Assistant.
