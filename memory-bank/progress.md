# Progress

## What Works

### 1. Core Integration Structure
- ✅ Basic integration setup
- ✅ Configuration flow
- ✅ Data update coordinator pattern
- ✅ Entity definition

### 2. Data Retrieval
- ✅ HTTP connection to Solax inverter
- ✅ Authentication with username/password
- ✅ Regular polling mechanism

### 3. Data Processing
- ✅ JSON response parsing
- ✅ Handling of empty values in arrays
- ✅ Processing of basic information fields

### 4. User Interface
- ✅ Configuration through Home Assistant UI
- ✅ Integration with Home Assistant's Devices & Services

## What's Left to Build

### 1. Sensor Creation and Updates
- ⏳ Ensure all sensors are correctly created
- ⏳ Verify that sensor values are properly updated
- ⏳ Confirm that all sensors have appropriate units and attributes

### 2. Testing with Different Inverter Models
- ⏳ Test with various Solax inverter models
- ⏳ Ensure compatibility with different firmware versions
- ⏳ Handle different response formats

### 3. Energy Dashboard Integration
- ⏳ Add energy sensors for the Energy Dashboard
- ⏳ Configure appropriate sensor classes for energy monitoring
- ⏳ Test integration with the Energy Dashboard

### 4. Documentation
- ⏳ Complete usage documentation
- ⏳ Add troubleshooting guide
- ⏳ Document all available sensors and their meanings

### 5. Testing Framework
- ⏳ Implement unit tests
- ⏳ Create integration tests
- ⏳ Set up CI/CD for automated testing

## Current Status
The integration is functional at a basic level but still requires verification and testing. The main issue addressed recently was handling empty values in the JSON response arrays, which was preventing proper data parsing. The solution involved extracting and cleaning the Data array before parsing the JSON.

## Known Issues

### 1. JSON Parsing
- The integration struggles with malformed JSON from the inverter, particularly with empty values in arrays
- We've implemented a solution that extracts and cleans the Data array, but it needs further testing

### 2. Sensor Creation
- Some sensors may not be created if the corresponding data is not available
- Need to verify that all expected sensors are created when data is available

### 3. Error Handling
- The integration may not recover gracefully from certain error conditions
- Need to implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Test the updated coordinator with actual inverter data
2. Verify sensor creation and updates
3. Add more comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. Update README with troubleshooting information
