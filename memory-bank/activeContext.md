# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on improving the integration's ability to handle various response formats from Solax inverters. Specifically, we're addressing issues with JSON parsing when the response contains empty values in arrays.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Improved JSON Parsing in Coordinator
We've updated the coordinator to better handle JSON responses with empty values in arrays:
- Added extraction of the Data array content using regex
- Implemented splitting of data values and replacement of empty values with 'null'
- Added reconstruction of the JSON with the cleaned data array
- Enhanced error logging to capture both original and cleaned responses

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
We've improved error handling throughout the coordinator:
- Added more detailed logging of HTTP responses
- Implemented better error messages for various failure scenarios
- Added logging of response content for easier troubleshooting

### 3. Logging Improvements
We've added extensive logging throughout the integration:
- Debug logging for raw and processed data
- Info logging for successful operations
- Error logging for failure cases
- Detailed logging of the data processing steps

## Active Decisions

### 1. Response Format Handling
We've decided to:
- First fetch the raw text response
- Extract and clean the Data array to handle empty values
- Then parse the cleaned response as JSON
- Process the parsed data into a usable format for sensors

### 2. Data Processing Strategy
We've implemented a strategy that:
- Processes both basic information and the Data array
- Handles null values gracefully
- Converts raw data into appropriate formats
- Creates a flat dictionary of processed values

### 3. Logging Level
We've chosen to:
- Log raw responses at the debug level
- Log processing outcomes at the info level
- Log all errors at the error level
- Include detailed context with all logs

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Solution
- Test the updated coordinator with different Solax inverter models
- Verify that all sensors are correctly created and updated
- Ensure that empty values in arrays are handled properly

### 2. Improve Sensor Definition
- Review the sensor definitions to ensure they match the processed data
- Add any missing sensors based on available data
- Ensure all sensors have appropriate units and icons

### 3. Enhance Documentation
- Update the README with troubleshooting information
- Add more detailed explanation of available sensors
- Include setup instructions for different inverter models

### 4. Testing Framework
- Implement unit tests for the coordinator
- Add integration tests for the full integration
- Create mock responses for testing different scenarios
